at first sight we can see that it makes a call to fopen function and it open's the file .pass of the next user

then it prints the username , we will exploit the printf vulnerability in order to print stack adresse's and look their respective values

after printing stack values we can notice that after read the passwod file its content is stored in the stack , 

Reminder : values a writen in reverse order  remember the memory addressing so we will still need to reverse them before deconding them from hex to get our password
