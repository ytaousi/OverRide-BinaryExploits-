no protections around the program to prevent us from looking at the functions bundled in the program

```
Disassembling the function main we can notice that it asks for input from the user then make a call to the function test with a value "322424845" held in the address (0x1337d00d)

lets disass the function test
```
![](./Resources/disassTest.png)
```
the function test has a big switch/case statment that contains 16 plus the default case 

going from case 1 to case 9 then case 16 to case 21

before executing the switch/case statement it makes a susbstraction  of arguments passed to the function test (argument2 - argument1) where the value 322424845 hold in the address (0x1337d00d) passed as argument2

after some straight bruteforcing whitout thinking  322424845 - 18  triggers a successful  call to the function system("/bin/sh") called in the function decrypt
