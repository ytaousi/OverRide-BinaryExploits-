no specific protections preventing us from looking at the functions compiled with the program

```
looking at the main function assembly it  makes a call to fork() then child is asking input from the user using gets() that doesnt control the length of the input
this input is meant to be stored into an array of 32 byte


the parent is waiting for the child process to be finished
the child process is ussing the ptrace() with PTRACE_TRACEME so that it is expecting the parent call for ptrace() on the pid of the child using  PTRACE_PEEKUSER
