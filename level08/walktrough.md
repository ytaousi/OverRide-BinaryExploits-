```
from first sight the program open the file at /home/users/level08/backups/.log

lets try to execute the program with :

~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
ERROR : Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

why not create this path  and try again  lets do it in /tmp for better practice and folder permissions
